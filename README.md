A quick way to make sure my writings are publicly accessible

### POPLSRC

My paper *accepted* to the '21 POPL Student Research Competition on Value Mutation Testing. Summarizes some of my initial findings during my thesis research

### Master's Thesis

My thesis on Value Mutation Testing. Code for my thesis is in a private repository pending future work in this direction.

### Rust EPCS Project

A semester project at ETH Zurich with Alex Summers. We formalized a representation of memory capabilities in Rust programs and I implemented an API making this information accessible to program analysis and verification tools (also in a private repository pending future work).
